          <p class="fitness-body-description"> So often, we move through the world unaware of our bodies' natural potential. In yoga, we  target specific muscle groups for strength and flexibility. The intentional sequencing and flow of poses allows you to deeply engage with the process and unlock your body's full potential.

                <p class="approach-description"> "In my experience, some studios can be an intimidating and competitive space to practice, which runs contrary to the meaning of yoga. My hope is to reconnect the practice of yoga, meaning to yolk or bring together, to its roots and to provide a supportive and comfortable environment in which students and instructors can learn from each other. When I first became ceritified, I searched for a community of people who fostered each other's growth rather than a search for the perfect photo. Eventually, I created my own community of yogis filled with supportive students and instructors who motivate each other, and it continues to grow. Before our first class, you and I will take the time to discuss your spiritual, fitness, and mindfullness goals so that I can design a personalized routine for you or your group. Whether it's your first class or your 20th year practicing I would love to hear from you and welcome you into my community."</p>

        <p class="description testimonialDescription02">"Anna is a knowledgeable and attentive yoga instructor. She mixes things up enough to keep me on my toes, but each class has a steady and logical flow that is both grounding and challenging. This may sound funny, but Anna has a great voice for teaching yoga - confident and soothing. She also makes great use of music and silence during class. My favorite part of Anna's classes is her ability to turn my complaints of pain in my shoulder or strain on my ankle, into a simple, easy adjustment that makes all the difference in the world! I can't recommend her enough.
